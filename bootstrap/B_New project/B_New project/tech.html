            <p>Innate qualities: The innate qualities of a teacher are known as his personal or innate qualities. These qualities are not changeable. But these qualities become paramount when it comes to success in the teaching profession. These are discussed below-

                Good health - A teacher has to work very hard in the teaching profession, in which case the main quality of a good teacher will be his good health. It is not said that he will be beautiful to look at, his personality should be able to attract students. Only then will he be able to influence the minds of the students. He will be able to bring success in his profession only if he has the impression of personality in his face.
                Voice- In the teaching profession, the voice of the teacher is considered as one of the elements. Because, it is the voice of a teacher that bridges the relationship between teacher and student. A teacher's voice should be loud and melodious.
                Clear pronunciation - There will be no inertia in a teacher's pronunciation. The pronunciation will be clear, free from stuttering and regional influences.
                Sharp intellect- A teacher must have sharp intellect. Conducting education is an  .</p>

            <p>Clear pronunciation - There will be no inertia in a teacher's pronunciation. The pronunciation will be clear, free from stuttering and regional influences.
                Sharp intellect- A teacher must have sharp intellect. Conducting education is an important task. Students need a lot of intelligence, judgment, prudence and vision to manage the school environment in a cohesive and orderly manner.
                Humor - What is most needed in the teaching profession is the sense of humor of the teacher. If the teacher does not have a sense of humor, he will not be able to touch the minds of the students. If a teacher uses a funny example when teaching in the classroom, it quickly enters the minds of the students, and the monotony of the classroom can be largely overcome.
                Patience and Tolerance - If a person does not have patience, I think he does not need to come to this profession. Because the main quality of the teaching profession is infinite patience and endurance. A teacher must listen patiently to the problems of the students and must be infinitely tolerant in order to fully grasp those problems..</p>

        <h3>World Class library</h3>
        <p>A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are accessible for use and not just for display purposes. A library provides physical (hard copies) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.

            A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources.

        <h3>Largest Play Ground</h3>
        <p>A playground, playpark, or play area is a place designed to provide an environment for children that facilitates play, typically outdoors. While a playground is usually designed for children, some are designed for other age groups, or people with disabilities. A playground might exclude children below a certain age.

            Modern playgrounds often have recreational equipment such as the seesaw, merry-go-round, swingset, slide, jungle gym, chin-up bars, sandbox, spring rider, trapeze rings, playhouses, and mazes, many of which help children develop physical coordination, strength, and flexibility, as well as providing recreation and enjoyment and supporting social and emotional development. Common in modern playgrounds are play structures that link many different pieces of equipment.
            
            Playgrounds often also have facilities for playing informal games of adult sports, such as a baseball diamond, a skating arena, a basketball court, or a tether ball.

        <h3>Testy and Healthy Food</h3>
        <p>The grim picture of people’s unaffordability to purchase nutritious food in Bangladesh revealed by a research conducted by the Institute of Nutrition and Food Sciences and the Institute of Health Economics at the University of Dhaka is very disturbing. It said 41 per cent of the country's households could not afford to buy nutritious food. Families below the poverty line or just above that are not able to buy the necessary nutritional food. Again some people, who have the ability, buy non-nutritive or less nutritional food instead of nutritive ones.

            On the other hand, a study conducted by the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) says that 21 million people in Bangladesh, or one in eight people, still do not have access to nutritious food. Many people are being deprived of essential nutrients due to unrestrained eating habits and lack of awareness. Due to this, 31 per cent of the children are not developing properly. </p>
