The ongoing global economic crisis is a result of shocks from both the demand and supply sides, but supply-side disruption is the dominant one. Bangladesh, like most developing countries, has been struck hard by this slowdown and the war in Ukraine, which is driving up the prices of food and fertiliser and exacerbating food insecurity and poverty. The pressure of the current price hike is beyond the endurance level of the low-income people in the country. We are also facing an escalated current account deficit, slow growth in remittances, stress on the US dollar exchange rate, and strain on the forex reserves to support a sufficient and comfortable number of months of imports. Bangladesh's economy depends significantly on foreign trade. More significantly, its exports, including ready-made garment (RMG) products, shrimps, leather, etc are heavily dependent on Western consumer demand. Therefore, a global recession is likely to have detrimental effects on Bangladesh's export potential.

There have been three types of responses so far from the government to counter the current challenges: several attempts to contain imports, some devaluation of the currency, and several austerity measures. The government has also started the process of securing a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the range of USD 4.5 billion, and some loans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank. There may be some conditions attached to the loans, especially from the IMF, which are likely to include undertaking reform in some critical areas, especially in the banking and taxation sectors. In the past, we have seen major disagreements among stakeholders in Bangladesh regarding adhering to the IMF conditionalities. But this time, we are seeing a kind of growing consensus on the necessity of such conditionalities that might seek reforms.
